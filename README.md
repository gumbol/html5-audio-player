A custom HTML5 audio player that include features like

[Here is a Demo](https://html5-audio-player.herokuapp.com)

## Requirments
jquery v3.3.1 or heigher (this is included with this repo)


## Getting started
* clone the repository
```html
$git clone https://github.com/gumbol/html5-audio-player
```

* If you did not download or clone the repository then make sure that you have the files in the same directory structure locally. Otherwise you will need to point index.html to the roght file path.

```html
## This is the default structure
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/html5-audio-player.css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/html5-audio-player.js"></script>
```
## Note
This is a simple demo of the flexability and the power of the new html objects. I havent add any extra functionality yet.
future development on this repo will include
* Process json and xml data
* Automate playlist creation
* Make seek bar draggable
* Adjust volume slider width to a more convenient length
* add numeral scale to the volume control
